### INTRODUCTION
- **The Testcase Recommendation System (TRS)** is the Recommendation System that aims to suggest suitable testcases for students based on their performances (the ability to solve assignment in Foundation Programming, Data Structure & Algorithm).
  - **Example**: System has 1000 testcases (#1, #2...,#100), student A has only passed 500/1000 testcases. The system would only provide a small testcase set that they had failed, like: #3, #4, #5 (that the Recommendation predict they would be most likely to solve that problem successfully the next time).
- The soul model of the **TRS**, RSVD model, was used to predict the student's correct answer for each testcase. Then some testcase that have mostly ability to solve would be choose to suggest to students. 
- **This thesis** enhances the TRS by researching the time factors and apply them by using AI model that incorporate time factors like: timeSVD, LSTM. Also, We build a custom web application to deploy them to students. The deployment had been successfull in 2 courses in the Computer Science field in Bach Khoa University.
### ðŸŽ¯Features Built
#### Lecturers

1. Log in to the system using Google email.
2. Create, view, and edit created assignments (or assignments added by other lecturers).
3. Register multiple students for an assignment by uploading a CSV file with the list of students (file must follow the correct format from the BKEL system).
4. Add lecturers to the assignment.
5. View the list of students for the assignment.
#### Students

1. Log in to the system using the school-provided Google email.
2. View assignments they have been registered for.
3. Create new submissions.
4. View the status and suggested test cases of their submissions.
5. Fill out surveys.

### KEY POINTS

- **SYSTEM OVERVIEW**

- **RELATIONAL DATABASE DIAGRAM**

- **PROJECT STRUCTURES**
We have 3 source code folder indicate 3 type of server: 
  - Grader - Backend for grading scores, 
  - TRS - Backend for handling logic and suggesting testcase, 
  - Frontend - Frontend for custom LMS Moodle

Some important folder that play a vital roles in program:

```
- ## HOW TO RUN?
  - First, install and use docker to manage processes.
  - In Postgres folder, run command: 'sh dockerrun.sh', this will run script to generate Postgres Database Image.
  - **In TRS**, run command: 'sh file.sh' where file is run_local, rebuild-and-redeploy... based on current .sh file in TRS to build and run TRS BE server.
  - **In Grader**, run command to run .sh file, similar to TRS
  - **In Frontend**, run 'npm run dev' to run in development mode, or 'npm run start' to run fe in production mode.

**Note**: Contact author to being completely guided about environment key for each server.
